    "comment": "I voted Abstain on this proposal because, while I support the projects included, I don’t believe there’s a strong need to submit a separate Governance Action for proposals that were already included in the main Intersect-led budget.\n\nAt this early stage in Cardano’s on-chain governance journey, it's important to keep the process simple and clear. Having multiple Governance Actions for the same set of projects — even if they’re well-supported — adds unnecessary complexity and could confuse voters, without offering clear added value.\n\nA single coordinated budget process, with transparent inclusion criteria and community signalling (like what Intersect facilitated), is the better path for now. This helps build trust, avoids fragmentation, and gives the ecosystem a cleaner, more unified way to manage treasury allocations.\n\nPlease reduce my workload, don't increase it."
