    "comment": "I voted YES because this proposal presents a well-structured approach to coordinating and funding key projects that support the Cardano ecosystem. We need this development and support of key Cardano projects within the ecosystem. It brings together 39 initiatives focused on development, governance, marketing, infrastructure, and innovation, all aligning with Cardano’s 2025 roadmap.\n\nThis is not a direct request for funds but a signal to recognise the combined budget so that future Treasury Withdrawals for each project can be submitted and approved individually. That ensures proper review and accountability for each step.\n\nAs the proposed administrator, Intersect will utilise smart contracts and multisig wallets whenever possible to manage the release of funds. There are built-in checks like due diligence, milestone tracking, and the ability to pause payments if terms aren’t met. All of this helps ensure the responsible use of treasury funds.\n\nApproving this proposal shows that Cardano is ready to move forward with on-chain budgeting in a transparent and decentralised way. It’s an important step in making governance real and in funding the work needed to keep the ecosystem growing and evolving."
