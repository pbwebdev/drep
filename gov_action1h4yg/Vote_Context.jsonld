    "comment": "I voted YES because the Amaru project makes Cardano stronger and more decentralised. Right now, we rely on just one main node (written in Haskell) to run the network. If something goes wrong with that, the whole system could be at risk. Amaru gives us a second, fully working option, built in Rust, a language known for safety, speed, and flexibility.\n\nHaving more than one node makes the network more secure and reliable. It also opens the door for new developers and use cases that are hard to do with the current setup. The team behind Amaru includes trusted names in the Cardano ecosystem, and they’ve planned carefully with clear goals, budget, and reporting.\n\nThe funding request is fair, ₳1.5 million for six months of work, and includes smart contract controls to make sure the money is used properly. This kind of proposal is exactly what Cardano’s treasury should support if we want a stronger, more resilient ecosystem in the long term."
