    "comment": "I voted NO on the proposal to set a 300 million ADA Net Change Limit (NCL) for Epochs 563–635 because it does not align with Cardano’s current treasury inflows and may hinder the ecosystem's growth.\n\nOver the past 12 months, the Cardano treasury has received approximately 315 million ADA, averaging about 4.32 million ADA per epoch . Setting the NCL below this replenishment rate could restrict funding for essential projects, including long-term initiatives that span multiple epochs.\n\nA more appropriate NCL would match or slightly exceed the annual inflow, ensuring that the treasury can support ongoing and future proposals without unnecessary constraints. This approach would provide flexibility and stability, fostering innovation and development within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nPlus, I've voted YES for the 350 NCL, which is set to pass and be enacted.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the proposed 300 million ADA NCL is insufficient and recommend adjusting it to better reflect the treasury's capacity and the community's needs."
