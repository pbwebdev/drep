I voted NO because a 200 million ADA limit is too low to support Cardanoâ€™s needs for the remainder of 2025. There are already well-developed budgets and initiatives prepared for on-chain funding, many of which span 12-month periods and require more than what this cap allows.

While caution is important in early governance, setting the NCL too conservatively risks stalling ecosystem growth and underfunding critical infrastructure. We need a realistic limit that reflects the scale of current proposals and gives the community room to build with confidence.
