    "comment": "This proposal falls under the pre-approved Cardano Budget 2025 list and supports a strategic five-year research program focused on advancing Cardano’s scalability, interoperability, and sustainability. IOR has a proven track record, with over 200 peer-reviewed papers and direct contributions to Cardano’s foundational technologies. The work program provides a structured pipeline from research to technology validation, ensuring ideas progress toward real-world implementation. The approach aligns with constitutional principles by strengthening infrastructure, fostering innovation, and maintaining transparency through defined milestones and oversight mechanisms. Given its critical role in securing Cardano’s long-term competitiveness and resilience, funding is justified."
