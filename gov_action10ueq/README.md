I voted NO because it’s too early to lock in a Net Change Limit for 2026. We don’t yet have a clear picture of what next year’s activity, funding needs, or actual treasury inflows will look like. Committing to a fixed amount now risks limiting our flexibility and may not reflect the real needs of the ecosystem when that time comes.

Cardano’s governance is still evolving, and we should be careful not to over-optimise too early. It’s more responsible to review and adjust the Net Change Limit closer to when it’s needed.
